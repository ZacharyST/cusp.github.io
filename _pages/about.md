The Computational Understanding of Social Processes Laboratory at UCLA's Luskin School of Public Affairs is committed to advancing the study of policy relevant questions using tools from the computatioanl social sciences.  By using large-scale publicly available datasets as well as working with industry partners, we seek to answer questions around themes of housing inequality, climate change, and social movements.  We are always looking for new collaborators, so please e-mail us if you are interested!
